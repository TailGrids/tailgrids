# Installation

As Tailgrids is heavily dependent on Tailwind, **before installing Tailgrids**, make sure you have a React project set up with Tailwind CSS. You can follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to set up Tailwind CSS in your react project.

Set up Tailgrids in your React project in just a few minutes.

### Install and Initialize

Run this command in your project root:

```npm
npx @tailgrids/cli@latest init
```

This initializes TailGrids by installing required dependencies, generating the config file, and adding base styles.

### Add Styles

Copy the contents of `tailgrids.css` into your main CSS file, such as `globals.css` or `app.css`, and make sure it’s included in your build.

### Add a Component

Use the CLI to add a component to your project:

```npm
npx @tailgrids/cli@latest add button
```

This will generate the component files in your project structure.

### Use the Component

Import and use the component in your app:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/core/button";

export default function Home() {
  return <Button variant="primary">Hello TailGrids!</Button>;
}
```

You’re now ready to build with TailGrids. Add more components, customize styles, and scale as your project grows.
